[Chinese Version Link](README_CN.md)

Today, green computing has been the goal pursued by various industries. In the cloud native computing market, with the huge commercial profits brought by cloud computing services and the rapid growth of the number of users, the increasingly mature cloud native technology and the future market in-depth application will further cause new attention to green cloud native computing. Reducing the energy consumption of cloud computing is the basic work to achieve green goals. This paper firstly analyzes the research methods of cloud native computing energy consumption under cloud conditions. Secondly, review and analyze the status quo and existing problems of cloud native key technologies in the research of infrastructure and computing energy conservation; Then, the energy-saving performance of typical cloud-native computing service cases is analyzed, compared and summarized, Then, it analyzes, compares and summarizes the energy-saving performance of typical cloud native computing service cases, and proposed the concept of cloud native energy-saving model and index. Finally, the problems existing in the current research are pointed out, and the future development direction is prospected. This research shows that the emergence of cloud native brings opportunities and challenges for the realization of green cloud computing. The future work will focus on tackling the key problems of energy-saving models and methods of cloud computing under cloud native senario, so as to provide a solid theoretical basis for practical application.
